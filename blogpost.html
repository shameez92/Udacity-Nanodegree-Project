                While almost all the men are engaged in sheep and cattle rearing, the women of the group do the household chores and bring up their children. 
                The extremely beautiful women of Kinnaur are expected to integrate the proper values and customs of their culture into the personality of the young children.

                However due to constant contact with the outsiders, some members of the young group also speak Hindi and other Pahari languages.
